================================================================================
6. TOLL ROAD REGULATIONS
================================================================================

6.1 TOLL ROAD OPERATION STANDARDS
    Primary Basis: PP 43/1993, PP 13/2002
    
    Key Requirements:
    - Strictly enforced speed limits
    - Electronic toll collection systems
    - Safety requirements (guardrails, signage)
    - Emergency response procedures
    - Speed enforcement technology
    
    Implementation in Program:
    - Speed limits: Cars 60-100 km/h, Trucks 60-80 km/h
    - Violation detection simulates enforcement cameras/radar
    - Fine system enforces payment for violations
    - Statistical tracking enables management reporting
    
    ============================================================================

6.2 TOLL ROAD SPEED LIMIT ENFORCEMENT
    Standard: Pasal 23 PP 43/1993
    
    Enforcement Points:
    - Speed cameras detect violations
    - Radar speed detection equipment
    - Toll gate monitoring systems
    - Police enforcement patrols
    
    Implementation in Program:
    - Simulated speed detection generates violation tickets
    - Violation rate: 35% (realistic for toll road traffic)
    - Car violation rate: 26% (8% too slow, 18% speeding)
    - Truck violation rate: 42% (16% too slow, 26% speeding)
    - Detection includes speeding and driving too slowly
    
    ============================================================================

6.3 SPEED LIMIT JUSTIFICATION
    Question: Why are these speed limits set?
    
    Answer per PP 43/1993 and Road Safety Studies:
    
    For Cars (100 km/h maximum):
    - Optimal safety on divided highway
    - Time for driver reaction (minimum 60 km/h)
    - Visibility requirements
    - Braking distance calculations
    - Passenger comfort and safety
    
    For Trucks (80 km/h maximum):
    - 20 km/h LOWER than cars per regulation
    - Reason: Heavy vehicles require longer braking distance
    - Load stability at high speeds
    - Tire durability limitations
    - Accident severity reduction
    - Fuel efficiency improvement
    
    Minimum Speed (60 km/h for both):
    - Prevents traffic congestion
    - Maintains toll road traffic flow
    - Minimum viable speed for highway driving
    - Safety consideration to prevent rear-end collisions
    
    ============================================================================

================================================================================
7. PENALTY AND FINE STRUCTURES
================================================================================

7.1 FINE AMOUNTS LEGAL BASIS
    Primary Source: PP 43/1993 and UU 22/2009
    
    Maximum Fine Amount:
    - Based on severity of violation
    - Primary violation type: Speed violation
    - Range: Rp 310,000 to Rp 1,250,000+
    
    Implementation in Program:
    - Base maximum: Rp 500,000 (USD $32.26 at 15,500 conversion)
    - Can reach Rp 700,000 with 1.4x multiplier
    - Converted to USD for international compatibility
    
    ============================================================================

7.2 FINE TIER SYSTEM
    Basis: Pasal 209 UU 22/2009 (Violation Classification)
    
    Tier 1 - Minor Speeding (1-10 km/h over):
    - Fine: Rp 310,000
    - Status: Light violation (Pelanggaran Ringan)
    
    Tier 2 - Moderate Speeding (11-20 km/h over):
    - Fine: Rp 410,000
    - Status: Medium violation
    
    Tier 3 - Serious Speeding (21-30 km/h over):
    - Fine: Rp 580,000
    - Status: Serious violation (Pelanggaran Berat)
    
    Tier 4 - Very Serious Speeding (31+ km/h over):
    - Fine: Rp 750,000+
    - Status: Very serious violation
    
    Tier 5 - Extreme Violation:
    - Fine: Up to Rp 1,250,000
    - Status: Criminal traffic offense
    
    Implementation in Program:
    - 5 tiers based on speed violation severity
    - Adjusted for toll road speed limits (60-100 km/h for cars)
    
    ============================================================================

7.3 PENALTY MULTIPLIER SYSTEM
    Legal Basis: Pasal 23 UU 22/2009 (Driver Obligations)
    
    Rationale:
    - Drivers with expired documents create additional danger
    - Encourages document renewal and compliance
    - Double punishment for compound violations
    
    STNK (Vehicle Registration) Penalty:
    - Non-Active Status: +20% (1.2x multiplier)
    - Legal Basis: Must maintain valid vehicle registration
    - Implementation: Applied when STNK expires
    
    SIM (Driver's License) Penalty:
    - Expired Status: +20% (1.2x multiplier)
    - Legal Basis: Must maintain valid driver's license
    - Implementation: Applied when SIM expires
    
    Combined Multiplier Calculation:
    - Formula: base_fine × (1.0 + stnk_penalty + sim_penalty)
    - No STNK or SIM penalty: 1.0x (no multiplier)
    - STNK expired only: 1.2x multiplier
    - SIM expired only: 1.2x multiplier
    - Both expired: 1.4x multiplier (maximum)
    
    Justification:
    - Each additional violation increases total penalty
    - Compound violations warrant enhanced penalties
    - Maximum 40% additional penalty (not excessive)
    - Encourages document compliance
    
    ============================================================================

7.4 FINE CALCULATION DOCUMENTATION
    
    Example Scenarios:
    
    Scenario 1: Legal Driver, Valid Documents
    - Speed violation: 15 km/h over limit
    - Base fine: Rp 410,000
    - STNK status: Active (no penalty)
    - SIM status: Active (no penalty)
    - Multiplier: 1.0x
    - Total fine: Rp 410,000
    
    Scenario 2: Driver with Expired STNK
    - Speed violation: 15 km/h over limit
    - Base fine: Rp 410,000
    - STNK status: Non-Active (expired) → +20%
    - SIM status: Active (no penalty)
    - Multiplier: 1.2x
    - Total fine: Rp 492,000
    
    Scenario 3: Driver with Expired SIM
    - Speed violation: 15 km/h over limit
    - Base fine: Rp 410,000
    - STNK status: Active (no penalty)
    - SIM status: Expired → +20%
    - Multiplier: 1.2x
    - Total fine: Rp 492,000
    
    Scenario 4: Driver with Both Documents Expired
    - Speed violation: 15 km/h over limit
    - Base fine: Rp 410,000
    - STNK status: Non-Active (expired) → +20%
    - SIM status: Expired → +20%
    - Multiplier: 1.4x
    - Total fine: Rp 574,000

    def generate_speed(vehicle_type):
        if vehicle_type == "car":
            # Legal range: 60-100 km/h
            # Generate speeds including violations
            # Violation rate: 26% (8% slow, 18% speeding)
        elif vehicle_type == "truck":
            # Legal range: 60-80 km/h
            # Generate speeds including violations
            # Violation rate: 42% (16% slow, 26% speeding)
    ```
    
    ============================================================================

8.3 FINE CALCULATION (utils/generators.py)
    
    Legal Implementation:

        # Determine base fine from 5-tier system
        base_fine = get_base_fine_from_tier(speed)
        
        # Calculate multiplier
        multiplier = 1.0
        if stnk_status == "Non-Active":
            multiplier += STNK_PENALTY  # +0.2
        if sim_status == "Expired":
            multiplier += SIM_PENALTY    # +0.2
        
        # Calculate total fine
